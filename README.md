# JS-Day-18-A
Movie App

This code is for a movie app webpage.

The HTML code defines the structure of the webpage, including the header and main content area, where movies will be displayed, and the search bar.

The CSS code defines the style of the webpage, including the colors, fonts, and layout of the elements.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the webpage. It retrieves movie data from an API, displays it on the webpage, and allows the user to search for movies using the search bar. When a user submits a search query, the JavaScript code updates the movie data displayed on the webpage to show only the relevant movies.
